It looks as though the original host of the excellent pSX PlayStation One emulator - [psxemulator.gazaxian.com](http://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/) - has gone down. The site hadn't been maintained in a while and I fear it may have been forever abandoned. As such, I've added the most recent version of the emulator to this site. You can find it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jf7ucwj876buhmh/pSX_1_13-1220.zip?dl=0).

Besides being easier to configure than ePSXe, pSX comes with a rather handy MIPS R3000a debugger that's very handy in reversing work. I used it extensively in writing my [Long range enemy attack mod](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=14998.0) for Final Fantasy VII.
