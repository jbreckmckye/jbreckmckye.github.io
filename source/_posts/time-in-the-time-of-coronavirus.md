COVID-19 has taken much from us, and one subtle loss I've felt is my sense of time. In the UK, at least, it's as if all our rituals were put on hiatus.

We might not have rituals like worshipping the arc of the sun, or the vanquishing of the winter frost, but even modern lives have an ebb and flow, a cyclical quality. The beginning of September school term; the big Christmas food shop. The dry Januaries and the big spring cleans in March.

To me the parallels are striking: if premodern rituals let early humans gather in groups to celebrate the passage of time, fatten up on available foods and renew their relationships with each other, modern rituals serve a similar purpose. They both help us bond and help us picture the progress of the year.

Rituals help turn time from an endless continuum to an ordered cycle, punctuated with wine, family and song. Knowing a new year is beginning is a spur to action, to improve ourselves and break bad habits. There is a negative side to knowing time's passage too: Spring is the season for suicide, not Christmas (contrary to myth). The idea of starting a whole new year can be too much.

Chaucer starts his Canterbury Tales with "April's showers sweet"; TS Eliot starts The Waste Land "April is the cruellest month". Both men chose April as their day zero. Humans think and live in cycles of time.

The lockdown has put time on an indefinite hiatus. All the tables are empty, all the parties are quiet. It quietly devastates the little family habits and quirks. There is no Easter break where the kids come up from the city to eat their traditional Sunday roast. There is no summer barbecue to renew our friendships. There may not be hope your son can be home from university to help put up the Christmas tree, as he always has. Different families will have their own equivalents.

Even macro time, time measuring the progress of lives, is put on pause. All the weddings are cancelled and the holidays skipped. House moves are nixed and couples put off having kids. 2020 was a year without landmarks, conclusions, resolutions or renewal.

Coronavirus has stolen that. It's not as painful a loss as the thousands of deaths, or the millions of lost jobs, the mounting debts and widespread fear for our loved ones. No-one could argue that. This isn't an anti-lockdown post either, at all. All I am writing is that time is one of several smaller losses, and insidious exactly because it so subtle and hard to mark.

I feel it already, how it's getting harder to talk to friends, think of things to write. It's feeling tougher to organise a call, stay abreast of everyone's lives. Maybe it's just me. What scares me though is that we could come out of lockdown strangers to each other. We could come out of lockdown expecting a return to normalcy when we actually have the hard work of learning to live together again, restoring those rituals. It might be harder than we think.

There is a way we can do better. This has been a hard year for me - no bereavements, luckily, but COVID did cost me my job, when my startup dissolved its software team. This was a blow but may have been a blessing: I had a terrible work-life balance, I poured my soul into unpaid overtime, part of a grand plan that revolved around life in the middle of London as a serial startup engineer. COVID made me rethink every word of that. It took losing 2020 to realise how precious 2021 could be, and years beyond. Time, freedom and opportunities can disappear before you know it.

Once you know this you can start making plans for life beyond COVID, but you have to be specific and lay the groundwork now. You can't just wait for the virus to disappear and then expect to pick up where we left off. You have to try to keep marking the rituals, keep doing your best, keep time meaning what it ought to. Reach out, substitute, planning anything is better than nothing. The challenge we owe our future selves is finding the fortitude to do so even amidst the pain of a Christmas pandemic. I wish everyone the very best of luck.
