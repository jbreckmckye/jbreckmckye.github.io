## Embracing FFVIII's plot holes

Final Fantasy VIII is... weird.

In the year 199X, seven teenagers at a military high school spend their days planning prom dates and munching hot dogs at the cafeteria. But they're also training to become ruthless special forces operatives as the school is a front for a millenia-long war against a sorceress... living several thousand years in the future.

Precisely because of the centuries oppression she's endured, the sorceress Ultimecia retroactively seeks revenge by wreaking havoc across time. Whilst trading cards and cramming for exams, Squall Lionheart and his gang must content with the Ultimecia's goal of denying all existence by compressing all time into a single endless moment. You also fight a T-Rex in the school gym.

_If you're not too familiar with the plot of FF8, read a recap [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII#Plot)_.

So FFVIII's plot is... contentious. Some would say it is full of holes.

For one thing, FFVIII is maddeningly reluctant to flesh out its history. Just who is Ultimecia, the sorceress from the future? What does she really want? No-one explains. There's only one character who hints he might know - the cantankerous (and Extremely French) Doctor Odine. And he outright refuses to explain, as he thinks it doesn't matter.

There's this huge hole in the middle of VIII's plot, and at first glance, it's temping to dismiss it all as bad writing and worse translation.

And that's not even picking up the amnesia subplot...

So, when I picked up the game for a replay recently, I didn't exactly imagine writing an essay defending FF8's plot holes. And yet - I've come to feel VIII's weirdness is a deliberate choice. The game wants to be vague, not because it lacks ideas, but because the real evil in its world is storytelling and history itself. Stick with me and I'll unpack this.

## The argument

Here's the idea: Final Fantasy VIII is about many things, but at the center of it are people so obsessed with history and mythology, and making sense of time, that they lose all perspective of the present. The infinite perspective of seeing across history warps people: it makes them justify atrocities; it steals from them their humanity; it makes them sacrifice everything that makes them themselves.

Ultimecia is so traumatised by the grief of her ancestors that through time-travel she retroactively commits the genocide that causes her own oppression. SeeD is so fearful of Ultimecia's wrath that it throws thousands of teenagers' lives at any Sorceress who emerges, brainwashing cadets with memory-destroying magic powers. Seifer is so obsessed with myth and movies that he plays his own fictional character, and ultimately sacrifices everything he holds dear.

But this puts the game in a quandary. FF games love to tell grand stories about the origins of their worlds. VII has its Lifestream and the Ancients; IX had Terra and Garland. FF Tactics has its elaborately architected story of religious charlatans, corrupt priests and supernatural horror. What do you do, though, when the gist of your story, is that Capital-S Stories on that scale are themselves evil and dangerous?

I think what happens, is that the game gets so disgusted at the misuse of history and myth, it decides to stop trying to explain itself. Stop trying to fill in Ultimecia and her origins. Stop trying to explain Hyne or the origins of the Sorceresses. Instead it just focuses on two kids, Squall and Rinoa, making their own future.

And I think that makes sense, within the game's own internal logic. Because I want to go over just _how much damage_ history ends up doing.

## History and myth in FFVIII

The first idea I want to get across is that - for FF8 at least - history and mythology are equivalent. Both attempt to reduce time to a single simpler meaning.

For those fighting against the Sorceress, History is nothing but an endless war against Her, a succession of women who inherit supernatural powers and are willing to use them politically.

For those fighting with the Sorceress, history is nothing but a Witch and her faithful Knight battling against all odds, protecting the descendants of Hyne, the great creator-god. 

In this world there's no line drawn between historical fact and mythological fiction.

[ Disc 4 sorceress battle / seifer as knight ]

Now, FF8 treats mythology very sceptically. Consider the first (playable) scene of the game:

[ picture first scene / medical ]

Squall is recovering from his fight with Seifer. He wakes up in a medical bay. Dr Kadowaki asks Squall to focus his eyes.

What's striking is its realism. This is _Final Fantasy_ after all. Squall isn't healed with a Curaga spell or a Megalixir; it's all very conventional medicine. Which tells us four things: FF8's world is like our own; technology is modern but restrained; magic if it exists is severely limited; and healing is done by doctors - not shamen. We're in a recognisably modern world, which puts us outside of mythology, and by defintion outside of history.

Outside of that, though, VIII is coy to provide details. You're a mercenary and your job is to complete missions to the letter, not get involved in politics. You're encouraged to keep the lore of the world, and the interpretation of its events, very distant.

### Myth at arms' length

When mythology does come up it's hazy. Only occasionally do you find characters willing to bring up how they think the world was created.

> hyne quotes

Even then, the Hyne story has the ring of a myth that's been translated too many times to be intelligible. There are "Guardian Forces", that resemble beings from religion and myth, but they're a motley pantheon with no obvious origin.

Depending on what fan theories you subscribe to, GFs like Griever might even be memes, cultural memory and ideas come to life, rather than beings that ever really existed.

[ griever moments ]

By setting the game in the modern day and telling us to withhold our judgement, Final Fantasy VIII wants us to keep history and myth at arms' length. Even when magic and monsters are introduced, it's always behind a semi-scientific or sci-fi mechanic.

Perhaps it's also why the focus of play is so much about stats and "junctioning" stats outside of battle, rather than performing superhuman feats in-battle: a game that's sceptical of myth is just as sceptical of heroes, and underplays their power.

## Seifer is the discarded hero of Final Fantasy VIII

In Squall's SeeD exam, his role is simple: follow a mission brief, don't leave the assignment zone, don't engage with civilians. You even get points docked from your exam result if you speak to NPCs. What the Dukedom of Dollet is, and what Galbadia want with their broadcast station, is none of our concern. We're military subcontractors, not heroes.

Except... we _do_ have a hero on the team: Seifer Almasy. He tells us himself - and he seems to be the only person who gives a shit about what Galbadia are up to in Dollet. He carries the same weapon as Squall, with the same R1-for-bonus-damage gimmick. He has unique "limit break" conditions and his "posse" of Raijin and Fujin give him a party of three - just like your traditional Final Fantasy protagonist.

[ seifer posing ]

And yet Seifer is punished _severely_ for his heroism. It wasn't until my recent playthrough I recognised just quite how unfair his treatment is.

When he gets back from Dollet, he's the object of utter contempt from Quistis and Xu - because Seifer stepping above and beyond represents a loss of earnings for SeeD. They'd rather the Galbadians run riot: it's good for business. Collateral damage and civilian death is inconsequential.

When Seifer abducts President Deling in Timber, it's because he's outraged that your team of three junior SeeDs were loaned out on a suicide mission:

```
Quistis: "He was so angry when he found out it was only
         the 3 of you dispatched to Timber.

         'What!? They might end up fightin' the whole Galbadian
         force! And all they dispatch are 3 rookie SeeD members!?
         Dammit! I'm going to Timber!'

         I never would have guessed he was serious about it."
```

However. Seifer's problem is that he knows he's a hero. He's theatrical, egotistical, he's obsessed with books and movies. He quotes the _Sorceress' Knight_ at length to Squall and he holds his gunblade _exactly_ like Laguna does in his famous _Sorceress' Knight_ movie:

[ laguna scene / gunblade -- vs seifer ]

Seifer's fiction-obsession makes him live like a protagonist, and fight against increasingly implausible odds. And boy, it costs him everything. Not just his humiliating defeats, but his values, his dignity, his selfhood. Early on he taunts Squall and friends for fighting like monsters, as a swarm of three against one. By Lunatic Pandora he recognises no such standards, when he seizes Rinoa off screen and sacrifices her to the monstrous Adel. His grand, theatrical coat is now worn and ragged; his slick-backed hair is now greasy and unkempt. Raijin and Fujin no longer recognise him.

He's become nothing, literally a Cipher in someone else's story.

## Violence begets violence

One of the things that always bothered me about FFVIII was that void where its villain is. I was used to Final Fantasy games with grand, bombastic, larger than life villains like Kefka, Sephiroth or Kuja. Ultimecia by comparison has very little screen presence.

I counted, and excluding what she says through Edea, she only directly speaks about eight lines  in total. Yet she's the ultimate cause of the entire Time Compression plot. Why she wants to do it is unclear, and what it even means to compress time, is a very abstract threat.

### Myth becomes history

Well, if we want to understand Ultimecia, we should start with what she says whilst possessing Sorceress Edea - her first lines in the game:

```
Edea: "...Lowlifes. ...Shameless filthy wretches. How you celebrate my
      ascension with such joy ... Hailing the very one you have condemned
      for generations. What happened to the evil, ruthless sorceress
      from your fantasies?

President Deling: "E-Edea... Are you alright...?"

Edea: "This is reality. No one can help you. Sit back and enjoy the show."

[The crowd cheers for Edea's speech; she tosses Deling aside.]

Edea: "Rest assured, you fools. Your time will come. This is only the
      beginning. Let us start a new reign of terror. I will let you live a
      fantasy beyond your imagination."
```

You probably know already that Ultimecia is going back in time to enact revenge for the oppression she's suffered over history. But take another look. What's interesting is the focus on _fantasy and reality_: the _fantasy_ of an evil sorceress; the _reality_ that's unfolding; the chance to _live_ that fantasy after all. Ultimecia is specifically punishing people for _mythology_ by making their *myths real*.

It's easy to read Ultimecia as a garden-variety megalomaniac, but I see her as a force of History. She lives to grieve the past, and even the parts of history that weren't true, she'll go back in time to *make real retrospectively*.

### History becomes myth

Ultimecia is _obsessed_ with history. Why does a woman 2000 years in the future live in a Renaissance-style castle, replete with sixteenth-century style portraiture? Even the castle soundtrack is a Baroque ensemble of organs and harpsicords, a pastiche of 17th century music:

[castle ost embed]

Compressing time - making all moments be experienced at once - is just another facet of that. Because that's essentially what History, when it runs out control, really _does_: by "over-matching" patterns across time, it "compresses" them into a simpler narrative.

And once you become obsessed enough with a single historical narrative, you're essentially living Time Compression already: experiencing the same meanings and emotions over and over. All joy becomes empty when you only have grief for the inevitable future; people and places just become interchangable soldiers on the forever battlefield. There's no meaning to anything, just war.

[ ultimecia - seed seed seed lokusts! ]

Eventually Ultimecia's grief becomes literal as she merges her body with a monstrous, man-eating being called _The Griever_. Finally, once that is destroyed, she reveals her real head, an empty void cradling a brilliant golden light. To me it always resembled a solitary candle in the blackness, a symbol of memorial to everything Ultimecia has lost, and the ultimate sum of what's really inside her.

[ ultimecia face ]

## Begets violence begets

[ cid shrug ]

But let's talk about SeeD for a moment. I think they're *far* more morally grey than first appreciated.

Let's review: to fight Ultimecia, Cid Kramer converted an orphanage into an elite paramilitary academy. He located orphans, as well as displaced, vulnerable and "troubled" children, and he trained them up as soldiers, released into battle at age 15. To increase their power, he introduces these children to Guardian Forces. What he doesn't disclose is that GFs demand a sacrifice for their power, by replacing memories in their hosts' heads.

Children who grew up together greet one another as strangers. Garden guidelines discourage forming relationships. SeeDs don't have friends, just colleagues, and they're willing to fight former compatriots to the death if a contract demands it.

If you can't remember anything, and you can never form friendships or relationships, just fight, I have to question - how different is that existence *really* from Time Compression? If your life is endless battle against the Sorceress with no friends, no connections, and no personal history, are you really doing that much better than what Ultimecia has in store for you?

At the end of history, all that was left of Ultimecia's was a glowing orb, a dying light of memory and grief. What was left in Squall's head, after ten years of SeeD brainwashing and repressed trauma?

[ squall face ]

And let's not forget how many SeeDs - mostly teens - die in this millenia-long war against the Sorceress. FF8 has a high-school setting to remind you that _these people are kids_. They talk about love, exploration and romance, because they are young adults with a lifetime of possibility ahead of them. _These_ are the people Cid Kramer sends on suicide missions against Galbadia, because legend has it that a trio of teenaged SeeDs eventually win. It's horrific. He's a monster.

### Child sacrifice in Final Fantasy games

There's a bigger theme I want to strike at, that stretches across other Final Fantasies. I think a lot of FF games in the late-90s era use youth sacrifice as a shorthand for civilisations that are fundamentally sick.

IX was probably the most overt about this: Vivi Orienteur and the Black Mages are beings manufactured to die young. IX's lore is about an ancient planet of infertile immortals, the Terrans, consuming the life energy of younger planets in a bid to keep their ancient civilisation alive.

X continues the idea with Summoners: teenagers who volunteer for a dangerous pilgrimage to fight a being called Sin - that they can only subdue by sacrificing their lives. This is a fraud, however, perpetuated by the elderly (undead) priests of Yevon.

In Final Fantasy VII the crisis is all-pervasive. The world is controlled by the dystopian Shinra Electric Company. Shinra's reactors are powered by the very "lifestream" that's required to conceive new life, sacrificing the young as a literal power source. Everywhere we go in VII's world, youths are leaving to go work in the city, whilst their villages slowly die. Shinra's armed force SOLDIER recruits teenagers aged 14, and subjects many to human experimentation, with grisly results:

[ makonoid ]

(You didn't think he was a consenting adult, did you?)

In FFVIII, kids are chewed up by the war machine on both sides. SeeD seeks out vulnerable children to turn into young soldiers. Meanwhile Sorceresses like Adel scour the land kidnapping little girls who might make successors.

So I don't think we can excuse how SeeD operates as just a bit of a plot contradiction, because the theme crops up so many times in FF to be less than deliberate. SeeD might be better than Ultimecia's tyranny, but the sacrifices they make are on a similar level of atrocity - and end up triggering Ultimecia's revenge anyway. And it largely happens because Cid Kramer's obsession with history leads him to decide that the ends justify the means.

## Squall

But Squall's arc cuts through this endless cycle of revenge and war.

For Squall, becoming part of the past doesn't mean becoming a legend, like it does for Seifer. It means losing control of your story and becoming part of someone else's narrative - that's what really freaks him out about death:

```
Zell: "I didn't like [Seifer], but executed...?"

Squall: (I liked him... wasn't really a bad guy... He was one of us...
        Seifer... You've become just a memory.)

        (Will they... Will they talk about me this way if I die, too?
        Squall was this and that. Using past tense, saying whatever
        they want? So this is what death is all about...)

        (...Not for me. I won't have it!!!)
```

As Squall grows through the story, his journey is to let go of his childhood trauma and embrace the possiblity of new friends and relationships. He stops caring about any narrative larger than that. Fighting Ultimecia is a faraway second to finding Rinoa:

```
Zell: "So, Ultimecia wants to use Ellone's power, right?"

Squall: (We had a lot of arguments at first. But in time, things
        began to change.)

Irvine: "I get it. Ultimecia wants to send her consciousness from
        this period further into the past."

Zell: "What's she going to do in the past?"

Squall: (You were looking at me... You smiled when our eyes met.)

Edea: "Time compression."

Zell: "Time compression?"

Squall: (It made me feel calm, tranquil.)

Edea: "It's time magic. Past, present, and future get compressed."

Zell: "What's going to happen to the world? Why do something like
      that?"

Squall: (Rinoa... Give me another chance.)
```

When Squall breaks, he resolves to focus on the here and now:

```
Squall: "Pandora whatever and Sorceress Adel are out of my hands. I don't even
        know where to look for Sis. The only think I know is Rinoa. The only
        thing I want to do for sure right now is for Rinoa. We're going to get
        Rinoa back!"
```

In the end, Squall doesn't care about the binary of Knights versus SeeDs. He's indifferent to history and contemptuous of plot. Falling in love with Rinoa offers him a future that sits outside the endless Sorceress War.

## Abandoning History means letting go of Lore

So the future Squall cares about - one with Rinoa - is a timeline that isn't bound within the Ultimecia time loop: it's not part of the present day nor the final battle of SeeD. It's also completely outside the scope of the game's plot -  this is an important idea, and we'll come back to it.

Squall's not the only one indifferent to the Sorceress War or even FF8 lore itself. Doctor Odine positively can't be bothered:

```
(Doc Odine): "Compressing time with magic... Vat good will it
              do for ze sorceress to compress time? There may be many
              reasons, but it doesn't matter. Let's just figure out
              vat Ultimecia is up to.
```

This is the _one man who worked side by side with Adel before secretly inventing anti-sorceress technology_. He is represented as the game's foremost scientist and inventor. He even creates the time machine Ultimecia uses to project her will on the past in the first place! This is our opportunity to learn the _truth_ about what Ultimecia truly wants. And `it doesn't matter`.

I used to rage at this scene! How could Square leave this completely ambiguous? The nearest thing we had to an explanation was Rinoa's, who argues that no-one else but Ultimecia could exist under Time Compression. But to what benefit? It just seemed like inexplicable nihilism.

But now I feel differently. Too many characters in Final Fantasy VIII want their equivalent of an Odine-brand explanation. A single sentence that summarises the history of the FF8 world, nice and pat. A single sentence that draws a battle line in an endless war between side A and side B.

And getting that sentence, getting that explanation, _is_ Time Compression. It reduces everything to a single experience, a single meaning. It means nothing else exists in a meaningful manner.

Doing that is as nihilistic as anything Ultimecia does. `I am Ultimecia. Time shall compress... All existence denied`. Grief and grief alone motivates her to reduce all existence to her own unquenchable anger and loss, perpetuating itself over the centuries. If Squall had taken the SeeD Prophecy too seriously, he could have accidentally done the same.

**History is the real villain of Final Fantasy VIII and the game wants no part of it.** Odine could have been written to fob us off with a simple explanation, about Ultimecia wanting absolute power or whatever. No. Instead he tells us that it really isn't important. We should take him at his word. None of the lore about Hyne or Griever or the Guardian Forces goes anywhere - because the game wants us to *move onto a different story*.

### Look at the final scene again

When I watched the final cutscene again, the credits read differently to me. Take another look.

[ cutscene camcorder film ]

It's a camcorder movie, of all of Squall's friends, celebrating in the Garden. Zell is there - munching hotdogs. Quistis is finally relaxed and happy. Selphie and Irvine are reconnecting after years split apart. Even Edea and Cid are remarried. Everyone is in good spirits, but where is Squall?

Rinoa turns to the camera, smiles, and it's obvious: Squall's behind the camera, filming a new story of his own.
