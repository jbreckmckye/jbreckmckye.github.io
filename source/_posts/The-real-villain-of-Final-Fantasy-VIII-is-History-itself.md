_Or: why I learned to embrace FFVIII's plot holes._

Final Fantasy VIII (1999) is a weird story.

In a modern day setting, a group of teenagers at a high-school-slash-military academy fight conflicts all over the world by day, at night heading on prom dates and munching hot dogs at the school cafeteria (limit: 3 per person). But the school is actually a front for a millenia-long war against a sorceress living thousands of years in the future, who is retroactively seeking revenge for the centuries of oppression she's endured. Her goal is to compress time into a single endless moment.

_If you're not too familiar with the plot of FF8, read a recap [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII#Plot)_.

Some of the plot twists are a little hard to swallow. Halfway through the game, it transpires that our entire party actually grew together... but failed to recognise each other due to the amnesiac effects of the "Guardian Forces" you use, supernatural beings that provide power beyond normal human capabilities. It's a leftfield twist that no-one expects - and the topic of GF amnesia is never raised again. For some players, it's too much disbelief to keep suspended.

But even beyond that, who exactly is Ultimecia, the sorceress from the future? What's her story? No-one explains. Your love interest in the present, Rinoa, becomes a sorceress too, and the two have some uncanny connections - but their nature is left unclear. What exactly does Ultimecia have to gain from compressing time into a single moment, given that sorceresses appear to be immortal? There's only one character who possibly knows, the cantankerous Doctor Odine, and he can't be bothered to answer.

You wonder: Why is this game so _maddeningly_ reluctant to explain its bigger picture - when almost every other Final Fantasy piles on detail after detail?

So, when I picked up the game for a replay recently, I didn't exactly imagine writing an essay defending (_some of_) FF8's plot holes. And yet - I think it's an argument. Stay with me.

<!-- more -->

Here's the idea: Final Fantasy VIII is about many things, but at the center of it are people so obsessed with history and mythology, and making sense of time, that they lose all perspective of the present. The infinite perspective of seeing across history warps people: it makes them justify atrocities; it steals from them their humanity; it makes them sacrifice everything that makes them themselves.

Ultimecia is so traumatised by the grief of her ancestors that through time-travel she retroactively commits the genocide that causes her own oppression. SeeD is so fearful of Ultimecia's wrath that it throws thousands of teenagers' lives at any Sorceress who emerges, brainwashing cadets with memory-destroying Guardian Forces. Seifer is so obsessed with myth and movies that he plays his own fictional character, and ultimately sacrifices everything he holds dear. The only person sane enough to pull out of this endless loop is Squall, who makes an active choice to leave history behind.

But this puts the game in a quandary. FF games love to tell grand stories about the origins of their worlds. VII has its Lifestream and the Ancients; IX had Terra and Garland. FF Tactics has its elaborately architected story of religious charlatans, corrupt priests and supernatural horror. What do you do, though, when the gist of your story, is that stories on that scale are themselves capable of harm?

I think what happens, is that the game gets so disgusted at the misuse of history and myth, that it decides to stop explaining itself. It stops trying to fill in Ultimecia and her origins. It stops trying to explain Hyne or the origins of the Sorceresses. Instead it opts to just focus on two kids, Rinoa and Squall, making their own future. Nothing outside that is explained because nothing outside that really matters.

But let me take a step back for a moment, and explain. I want to go over just _how much damage_ history does in this story.

## History and myth in FFVIII

The first idea I want to get across is that - for FF8 at least - history, plot and mythology are just faces of the same thing. They're all about attempts to reduce time to a single meaning.

For those fighting against the Sorceress, history is nothing but an endless war against Her, a succession of women who inherit supernatural powers and are willing to use them politically. For those fighting with the Sorceress, history is nothing but a Witch and her faithful Knight battling against all odds, protecting the descendants of Hyne, the great creator-god. In this view of the world, history and myth are just faces of the same coin.

[ Disc 4 sorceress battle / seeds dead ]

FF8 treats mythology very sceptically. Consider the very first scene:

[ picture first scene / medical ]

Squall is recovering from his fight with Seifer. He wakes up in a medical bay. Dr Kadowaki asks Squall to focus his eyes.

What's striking is the realism. This is _Final Fantasy_ after all. Squall isn't healed with a Curaga spell or a Megalixir; this is conventional medicine through and through. The scene tells us four things: FF8's world is like our own, technology is modern but restrained; magic if it exists is severely limited; and healing is done by doctors not shamen. We're in a recognisably modern world, which kind of puts us outside of mythology, and by defintion, outside of history.

Outside of that, though, VIII is coy to provide details. You're a mercenary and your job is to complete missions to the letter, not get involved in politics. You're encouraged by your mentors and the early mission descriptions to remain detached, and stay sceptical of interpretations of world history. You're here to fight, not think.

As for mythology itself, it's all very distant and hazy. Only occasionally do you find characters willing to bring up how they think the world was created. Even then, the Hyne story has the ring of a myth that's been translated too many times to be intelligible. There are "Guardian Forces", that resemble beings from religion and myth, but they're a motley pantheon with no obvious origin. Depending on what fan theories you subscribe to, GFs like Griever might even be memes come to life, rather than beings that ever really existed.

[ griever moment ]

By setting the game in the modern day and telling us to withhold our judgement, Final Fantasy VIII wants us to keep history and myth at arms' length. That's why even when magic and monsters are introduced, it's always behind a semi-scientific or sci-fi mechanic. It's possibly why the focus of play is so much about stats and junctioning outside of battle rather than performing superhuman feats in-battle: a game that's sceptical of myth is sceptical of heroes.

## Seifer is the discarded hero of Final Fantasy VIII

In Squall's SeeD exam, his role is simple: follow a mission brief, don't leave the assignment zone, don't engage with civilians. You even get points docked from your exam result if you speak to NPCs. What the Dukedom of Dollet is, and what Galbadia want with their broadcast station, is none of our concern. We're military subcontractors, not heroes.

Except we _do_ have a hero on the team: Seifer Almasy. He tells us himself - and he seems to be the only person who gives a shit about what Galbadia are up to in Dollet. He carries the same weapon as Squall, and he has the same in-battle gimmick where you can hit R1 as he strikes to increase damage. He has special limit break conditions and he has his posse of Raijin and Fujin, giving him a party of three - just like your traditional Final Fantasy protagonist.

[ seifer posing ]

And Seifer is punished _severely_ for his moment of heroism. It wasn't until my recent playthrough I figured just quite how unfair his treatment is. When he gets back from Dollet, he's subject to utter contempt from Quistis and Xu - because Seifer stepping above and beyond represents a loss of earnings for SeeD. Allowing the chaos to continue is good business for Garden, it's that simple.

When Seifer abducts President Deling in Timber, it's because he's outraged that your team of three junior SeeDs were loaned out on a suicide mission:

```
Quistis: "He was so angry when he found out it was only
         the 3 of you dispatched to Timber.

         'What!? They might end up fightin' the whole Galbadian
         force! And all they dispatch are 3 rookie SeeD members!?
         Dammit! I'm going to Timber!'

         I never would have guessed he was serious about it."
```

But Seifer's problem is that he knows he's a hero. He's theatrical, egotistical, he's obsessed with books and movies. He quotes the _Sorceress' Knight_ at length to Squall and he holds his gunblade _exactly_ like Laguna does in his famous _Sorceress' Knight_ movie:

[ laguna scene / gunblade -- vs seifer ]

Seifer's fiction-obsession makes him live like a protagonist, and fight against increasingly implausible odds. And boy, it costs him everything. Not just his humiliating defeats, but his values, his dignity, his selfhood. Early on he taunts Squall and friends for fighting like monsters, as a swarm of three against one. By Lunatic Pandora he recognises no such standards, when he seizes Rinoa off screen and sacrifices her to the monstrous Adel. His grand, theatrical coat is now worn and ragged; his slick-backed hair is now greasy and unkempt. Raijin and Fujin no longer recognise him.

He's become nothing, literally a Cipher in someone else's story.

## Violence begets violence

One of the things that always bothered me about FFVIII was the void where its villain is. I was used to Final Fantasy games with grand, bombastic, larger than life villains like Kefka, Sephiroth or Kuja. But Ultimecia has really very little screen presence. In fact, excluding what she says through Edea, she only directly speaks about eight lines through the game. Yet she's the ultimate cause of the entire Time Compression plot. Why she wants to do it is unclear, and what it even means to compress time, is a very abstract threat.

If we want to understand Ultimecia, it's best to start with what she says when possessing Sorceress Edea:

```
Edea: "...Lowlifes. ...Shameless filthy wretches. How you celebrate my
      ascension with such joy ... Hailing the very one you have condemned
      for generations. What happened to the evil, ruthless sorceress
      from your fantasies?

---      

President Deling: "E-Edea... Are you alright...? Ede...!"

Edea: "This is reality. No one can help you. Sit back and enjoy the show."

[The crowd cheers for Edea's speech; she tosses Deling aside.]

Edea: "Rest assured, you fools. Your time will come. This is only the
      beginning. Let us start a new reign of terror. I will let you live a
      fantasy beyond your imagination."
```

Everyone knows Ultimecia is going back in time to enact revenge for the oppression she's suffered in the past. But take another look. What's interesting to me is her focus on _fantasy and reality_: the _fantasy_ of an evil sorceress; the _reality_ that's unfolding; the chance to _live_ that fantasy after all. Ultimecia is specifically punishing people for _mythology_ by making their myths horribly real.

It's easy to read Ultimecia as a garden-variety megalomaniac, but I prefer to see her as a force of History. She lives to grieve the past, and the parts of history that weren't even true, she'll go back in time to make true after all.

Ultimecia is _obsessed_ with history. Why does a woman from 2000 years in the future live in a Renaissance castle, replete with sixteenth-century style portraiture? Why is its theme tune, at the end of all history, a Baroque ensemble of organs and harpsicords? On one wing of the castle, a clock tower is frozen in a single moment.

Compressing time - making all moments be experienced at once - is really just another facet of that. Because that's essentially what History, when it runs out control, really _does_: by finding patterns across time, it compresses them into a simpler narrative. Once you become obsessed enough with a historical narrative, there's not really much difference between that and Time Compression: in both cases, you experience the same meanings and emotions over and over. All joy becomes empty when you can only think of future grief; people and places just become interchangable soldiers on the forever battlefield. There's no meaning to anything, just the War.

[ ultimecia - seed seed seed lokusts! ]

Eventually Ultimecia's grief becomes literal as she merges her body with a monstrous, man-eating being called _The Griever_. Once that is destroyed, she casts off her body and reveals an empty void for a head, cradling a brilliant golden light. To me it always resembled a solitary candle in the blackness, a symbol of memorial to everything Ultimecia has lost.

## Begets violence begets

[ cid shrug ]

But let's talk about SeeD for a moment.

I've got some strong opinions here. For the last twenty years, I think Final Fantasy fans have given SeeD enormous leeway for the means by which they fought the Sorceress Wars.

Let's review: to fight Ultimecia, Cid Kramer converted an orphanage into an elite paramilitary academy. He found orphans, as well as displaced, vulnerable and "troubled" children, and he trained them up as soldiers, released into battle at age 15. To increase their power, he introduces these children to Guardian Forces. What he doesn't disclose is that GFs demand a sacrifice for their power, by replacing memories in their hosts' heads.

Children who grew up together greet one another as strangers. Garden guidelines discourage forming relationships. SeeDs don't have friends, just colleagues, and they're willing to fight former compatriots to the death if a contract demands it.

If you can't remember anything, and you can never form friendships or relationships, just fight, I have to question how different that existence really is from living under Time Compression. If your life is endless battle against the Sorceress with no friends, no connections, and no personal history, are you really doing that much better than what Ultimecia has in store for you?

And let's not forget how many SeeDs - mostly teens - die in the millenia-long war against the Sorceress. FF8 has a high-school setting to remind you that _these people are kids_ and they have their whole lives ahead of them. They talk about love, exploration and romance, because they are young adults with a lifetime of possibility ahead of them. _Those_ are the people Cid Kramer sends on suicide missions against Galbadia, because legend has it that a trio of teenaged SeeDs eventually win.

### Child sacrifice in Final Fantasy games

There's a bigger theme I want to strike at, that stretches across other Final Fantasies. I think there's several FFs from that era, in the late 90s, that use child sacrifice (or teen sacrifice) as a shorthand for sick and unsustainable civilisations.

IX was probably the most overt about this: Vivi Orientur and the Black Mages are manufactured beings engineered to die at an early age. Its 'big narrative' is about an ancient planet of infertile immortals, the Terrans, consuming the life energy of younger planets in a bid to keep their ancient civilisation alive.

X continues the idea with the Summoners: teenagers who volunteer for a dangerous pilgrimage to destory a being called Sin - that they can only subdue by sacrificing their own lives. This is fraud, however, perpetuated by the ancient and largely undead priests of Yevon.

In Final Fantasy VII the crisis is all-pervasive. Shinra corp is the de-facto world government and everywhere you visit, the young have been leaving their villages to work in the dystopian Midgar. Shinra's reactors are powered by the very "lifestream" that's required to conceive new life. What's more their armed force SOLDIER recruits mostly teens aged forteen and over, many subject to human experimentation. The results are... grisly.

[ makonoid ]

So I don't think we can just excuse how SeeD operates as an isolated oddity meant to be left unexamined. Final Fantasy games are about kids partly because that helps them target a player demographic, but also because teenagers represent options for how society can play out and the world can be changed.

A military machine that consumes their bodies is supposed to be a horrifying threat, and the mind-warping powers of the GF make it hard to really give SeeD the moral high ground over the likes of Ultimecia. And it happens because an obsession with history leads Cid Kramer to decide the ends justify the means.

## Squall

[ squall was this and that? i won't have it! ]

```
Edea: "Ellone's mysterious power... Sending one's consciousness back into the
      past."

Zell: "So, Ultimecia wants to use Ellone's power, right?"

Squall: (We had a lot of arguments at first. But in time, things began to
        change."

Irvine: "I get it. Ultimecia wants to send her consciousness from this period
        further into the past."

Zell: "What's she going to do in the past?"

Squall: (You were looking at me... You smiled when our eyes met.)

Edea: "Time compression."

Zell: "Time compression?"

Squall: (It made me feel calm, tranquil.)

Edea: "It's time magic. Past, present, and future get compressed."

Zell: "What's going to happen to the world? Why do something like that?"

Squall: (Rinoa... Give me another chance.)
