On the 27th January, 2022, the UK eased back its Coronavirus "plan B" restrictions - such as they were. I was hoping I'd feel something more momentous and freeing. What I'm actually feeling is much more murky and ambiguous. This winter has been tough, and I, I feel like it has changed me.

Some words. I know, objectively, the last three months have been some of the softest restrictions we've been under, anyone's been under. They were nowhere as tough as two years ago, when the world came to a standstill; they were nowhere as tough as one year ago, when the virus tore through our hospitals and care homes; they nowhere as wretched and painful and pitiless as last Christmas, which I spent alone. But - for me - I found myself far more drained, more dispirited and even disturbed. This time I couldn't see path back to normal.

At the time the first lockdowns broke out, April 2020, I treated it as a bargain, a trade, a compromise made with the world, the kind of trade you narrate to give yourself some agency when you're really under compulsion. "I will give up my job and my friends and my freedom", I said to the world, raising my chest, "and you will give us time to invent a vaccine". The virus abated, summer bloomed, and we cautiously emerged. Before the next waves. "I will give up this year, I will give up on touching any other person", chest raising again, "and you will give us time to vaccinate". And so it went.

This Christmas was different. We weren't staying home to make new medicine, distribute jabs, or get "on top" of Coronavirus. It wasn't a deal we were making with the world, something we could rationalise as a choice. Omicron came, it killed, we stayed at home, to banish the nth variant of x variants until the nth + 1, and it will suffocate us again.

But what was I really after? I have spent two years pining for a "return to normal", meaning that I hoped the world of 2022 would be the same as the world of 2019. But... that couldn't ever be so. Things change.

There's a saying that being critical is disappointment that people weren't who you wanted them to be - which underlines quite nicely how absurd it is to be critical all the time. Obviously, living under the pandemic has been awful. Screamingly, pitilessly, nail-rendingly awful. But I've also carried a share of disappointment and even anger that the world has changed, that it couldn't be like the version of the pre-pandemic world I carried in my head.

Looking back I might have overrated it. Where was I in 2019? For one thing, I was a workaholic. I want to write about this at length elsewhere, but the word 'workaholic' isn't meant as 'spends too long on presentations when he could be watching _The Witcher_'. I had a problem: using work and career to regulate my emotional state, which is really a kind of (socially acceptable) dependency.

In 2019 I was overworked, obese, I rarely dated, I relied on work drinks to prop up my social life, I bought stuff - objects, clothes, holidays - to try and make peace with how unhappy I really was. And then I look where I am now, what I've gained over the pandemic:

- I don't go for drinks every Friday, but I have a small circle of meaningful friendships. Some people I can only talk to online, because they're shielding - but I know I can rely on them.
- I've lost a huge amount of weight, about 16kg (two and a half stone). I look better and I feel great. Most importantly, my fasting blood sugar is significantly down (this is a risk factor for diabetes).
- I dated someone last year... briefly. It wasn't a long relationship and it ended abruptly - but I didn't sit around doing nothing.
- I moved into a home I _like_ and doesn't feel like a compromise.
- I can run! Yes, running is the most vanilla of pandemic hobbies, but it's something I can do whatever happens with the virus. I did my first 10k a few months ago; the last one I did in 51 minutes.

Am I really sure I want to pine after my life in 2019? That was two and a half years ago. Things change. I changed. Largely for the better. I could do all these things above at one of the worst times. I learned who I can be and how resilient I am.

And there's a larger point about the pandemic. You know, before COVID hit movies taught us the biggest threat in an apocalypse would be the masses rioting and going feral; that the moment the norms of the world dissolve humanity's bestial instinct tears through the tenuous veneer of civilisation. Actually, in this apocalypse, the biggest threat were the people who wanted everything to remain as normal. Plugging their ears and "doing their own research" on virology. The people who yanked folk back into the office and smouldered with anger to think someone might be _working from home_ (obviously a skiver). The biggest danger in COVID-19, after the virus itself, was the people who desperately wanted to act like it was 2019.

Nostalgia is an intoxicant. It's fun to visit once in a while but if you live that way 24/7 it distorts your view of what's good about today. I've spent all this time howling in pain and disappointment that life has been stopped and I've forgotten to take stock.

I am cautious about 2022. I think it will take time for us to emerge again. I think it will be hard to risk disappointment. I think we will try impersonating the people we were three years ago only to realise we're not quite them any more, and we don't quite want what they did. The healthiest thing is to embrace that.
