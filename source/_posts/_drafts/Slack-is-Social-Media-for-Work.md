If you're a programmer or tech worker you're probably familiar with Slack. The group chat app appeared in 2014 and quietly set to work converting droves of enthusiasts, team by team, workplace by workplace. I started using it at Rightmove and it seems to have followed me about ever since.

Four years later Slack now boasts nine million weekly active users across over a hundred countries [1]. That's the kind of phenomenal growth you'd associate more with a Facebook or an Instagram than a "workplace collaboration platform".

And there's the rub. Slack hasn't just 'spread like social media' - it _is_ social media. Slack is as much about social relationships between coworkers as it is about actual work. It uses clever design and psychological tricks to keep you engaged and entertained, even against your own interests. It steals your attention and at its worst creates ceaseless, unrelenting, artificial urgency.

Group chat is becoming a monster. How do we tame it?

- What's the problem, exactly?

-- pay yr debts (Adrienne LaFrance, whoever pointed out the effects of 'several people are typing', notifications)

-- constant notifications, no filtering, enemy of focus

-- have to respond immediately (hard to save things up)

-- inefficient for debates - drip-drip of messages - but too immediate for reflection

-- artificial obligations (reciprocity, timeliness)

-- FOMO

-- it's *too* personal (more about rehearsing social structures than getting work done)

- Diagnosing Slack syndrome

-- you find yourself clicking into Slack reflexively when you're supposed to be up to something else
-- you feel like you can't turn off Slack lest you miss an important decision
-- you return from vacation to check Slack, just like email

- What you can do about it

-- don't kill the messenger...
-- limit the decisions you make using Slack
-- use Slack to generate ideas, but only commit to them in a public meeting
-- learn how to run really good meetings: set an agenda, decide your purpose, write a briefing note
-- stick to the desktop webapp
-- use pomodoro to focus
-- give (positive) feedback via non-Slack channels
