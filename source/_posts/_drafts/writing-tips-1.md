I have no business telling anybody how to write. I work as a programmer, meaning I spend most of my days thinking and speaking in a strange mathematical code of numbers, runes, magic incantations and all those keyboard characters you've forever pondered the use of, ones like `^` and `{}` and `|>`. Most computer code looks like an alien's attempt to explain quantum hyperdrive technology in a vocabulary of sixteen words, via telegraph.

Before I was a programmer, I studied English Literature at university, which is always a sure way to learn to write badly. Literary theory textbooks, it might surprise you, contain some of the worst prose you'll ever read:

```
The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.
```

There's a good idea buried in here - I promise - but you'll need to do a lot of digging.

So why would an amateur like me, raised on such poor writing, think himself qualified to post a list of writing tips? Why not let someone truly talented have a go? Well, for the same reason it's pointless asking a natural born athlete for sports advice: what they do is so instinctive, they can't even name it. They can't explain what they do because they've never _not_ been able to do it. Better to find a budding amateur, someone like yourself: a person who likes language, loves writing, but has never been given much helpful advice on it.

Because most writing advice is frankly hopeless. The worst are trite aspirations like `BE SINCERE` or `OMIT NEEDLESS WORDS`. Telling me to "omit needless words" is like telling me not to overcook my roast: I know I need to do that, what I don't know is _how_.

Not much better are stern rules forbidding certain kinds of language. Some are plain silly, like `NO SPLIT INFINITIVES`, which comes to us from 18th and 19th century scholars who noticed that Latin verbs never did this, and thought emulating a two-thousand-year-old dead synthetic [1] Romantic [2] language was a valuable endeavour when writing English, a Germanic [3] analytic [4] language in the modern day.

More problematic are the rules that look superficially plausible, like `AVOID PASSIVE VERBS`. It's true that passive verbs can suck a energy out of your prose, but it's also true that they help you arrange the topics of your sentences, which is crucial to making paragraphs feel cohesive (more on this below). They also help cut unnecessary actors. The biggest issue, though, is that most bureaucratic writing suffers much worse issues than passives, and fiddling with verbs is a distraction from the bigger problems.

What follows is a set of simple principles for writing prose that are - I hope - specific enough to be useful but open-ended enough to be applied creatively. Few of them are my own and I take no credit for inventing any of them.

## Personas

## Subjects/Verbs :: Characters/Action

## Sentences should flow old information -> new

## Keep topics coherent

## Use topics to assign responsibility

## Emphasis always falls on the ends of sentences

## Form paragraphs of a short introduction then a longer discussion

## Put key point at end of paragraph introduction

## Sentences as Stories

Storytelling is perhaps the most ancient form of continuous human discourse. It is the first kind of speech we learn as children, and no other use of language can communicate quite so much so persuasively.
