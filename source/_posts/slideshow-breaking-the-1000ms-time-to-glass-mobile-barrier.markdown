I found a nice slideshow by Googleâ€™s Ilya Grigorik a few weeks ago, taking an overview of the essential issues in optimizing initial web page render time.<!--more-->

The talk was mobile-oriented, but many of the same concerns apply to desktop sites. You can find the slides on [Ilya Grigorik's blog](https://www.igvita.com/slides/2013/breaking-1s-mobile-barrier.pdf)

Some key points:

+ 4G is not a 'magic bullet' for mobile performance problems. Our customers are going to be stuck with 3G for quite some time, and TCP-slow-start imposes harsh bottlenecks.
+ Waking up the radio on mobile devices is slow. Radio is typically turned off after idling for 100ms; subsequent requests suffer a significant warm-up penalty, even on 3G (where it can be up to 2.5 seconds)
+ Rendering is blocked as the browser constructs the DOM and CSSOM. Inlining ATF (above-the-fold) styles and bootstrapping further styles asynchronously may be a useful strategy
+ Inlining styles for above-the-fold content might be a wise strategy
