After twelve months of radio silence I’m resuming the blog under a new design – and, more importantly, a new focus on development rather than UX.<!--more-->

As 2012 dragged on, I found it harder and harder to channel my passion for UX. The work and the world I once loved became a chore to interact with, and my content dried up as a result. The last year has been quite tumultuous, but the upshot is that after a lot of soul-searching I’m now doing exclusively what I always really loved – software development. It’s quite an unusual move, but I’ve never been so convinced that I’ve made the right one.

I’ll be writing some posts on my reasons for this and how I made the transition in the future, but in the meanwhile, anyone who’s come here for UX stuff should check out the [UX archives](/blog/categories/ux/).
