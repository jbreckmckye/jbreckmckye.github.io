This post is for potential career-changers looking at software engineering, but worried a non-STEM degree will hold them back. Its message is this: transitioning is very possible, but like all things worth doing, it's not always easy. Becoming a developer is tough, even for computer science graduates, so you'll need both the drive and long-term committment to make it a reality. Nevertheless: if you have the attitude and the aptitude, building software might be one of the finest vocations of all.

## Who am I? Some context

I graduated in 2009 with a degree in English from the University of Cambridge, UK. This was a highly varied programme that covered everything from ancient Greek tragedy to twentieth century prose, art criticism, history of ideas, origins of the English language, paleography, everything Shakespeare wrote, Gilgamesh for some reason, aesthetic philosophy and what felt like an entire year of *Beowulf*. It did not, however, involve very much technology. Essays were generally handwritten and I didn't even own a laptop until my final year. It could have been a lot worse: until the 1960s, students at Cambridge had to submit essays in Latin.

Today, I'm a senior developer with about six years' experience writing mostly JavaScript and TypeScript applications, including high-performance low-GC WebVR programs, low-latency ad trading systems, many Node.js microservices, content sites with 1000ms time-to-glass rendering targets, isomorphic TypeScript React apps, Knockout-based SPAs for use in ancient IE6-powered corporate environments, code for smart TVs, analytics platforms with high performance animated visualisations, things like text layout engines and a wealth of Electron desktop apps using a combination of multithreaded JS, webGL and native code written in C++. 

I've done this as both a member of larger 'agile' teams, lead developer and as a sole engineer building proof-of-concept work for fledgling businesses. I am no John Carmack, but I think I've enjoyed a rewarding career that roughly aligns with what many career changers would aspire to.

I feel incredibly lucky to have a vocation that is at once stimulating, creative, analytical, expressive, rigorous, open-ended, culturally important, highly imaginative, extremely practical, full of camaraderie, ever changing, steeped in history, sometimes hard work and always incomplete but rarely ever boring if you're doing it right.

And all of the above - all of it - I did without any conversion course, masters degree, bootcamp, or training programme. I didn't pay for a video course on JavaScript, I didn't go to a coding dojo and I don't think I ever bought more than three books about technology. I mostly just used my spare time, the internet, and a little help from some mentors. My approach won't work for everyone, and this post isn't an attack on any of those resources, but it's illustrative of how far you can go with almost no financial outlay.

Here is my story.

## The beginnings of my journey to programming

From ages eight to sixteen I was drawn quite irrepressibly to computers, and especially programming, but struggled due to want of an internet connection. After much pleading I convinced a friend to download me a BASIC compiler and save it onto my sole floppy diskette, and must have spent hundreds of hours writing simple quiz programs, maze games, a Tetris clone and a highly derivative space shooter called *Space Warrior 3* (Space Warrior one and two did not compile, you see).

Emboldened by my successes, I asked him to get me a C++ compiler, and promptly hit a brick wall of incomprehensible errors, compiler warnings and segfaults. Dejected, I assumed I failed because I had some kind of fundamental cognitive shortcoming, and not the fact I had almost no documentation, was coding in Notepad.exe and using a compiler from 1989.

After that experience, I didn't program again for almost ten years. Other interests flourished, and I decided I wanted to be a literary critic, so off I went to Cambridge.

## Deciding to become a developer

-- doing work as designer
-- made friends with developers, Adrian M. (Sarah D, Suk Yee L.)
-- evening and weekend bugfixes, enhancements
-- moonfruit
-- technical test
-- offer in pocket
-- ultimatum
-- waiting
-- provisional trial
-- a year of just CSS / HTML

## Learning JavaScript

-- at the same time: personal projects
-- devouring articles, things on MDN
-- codecademy
-- started to play with raphael
-- opportunity to do some visualisations
-- first go at writing JS professionally
